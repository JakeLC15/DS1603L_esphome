DS1603L Ultrasonic Sensor External Component with Level and Volume

Use a DS1603L ultrasonic sensor without modification.
These sensors read from the bottom of a tank and need to have some kind of couplant for them to work. There can be no air gap between sensor and bottom of container. I use clear silicone grease, easily found at most automotive or hardware stores.
